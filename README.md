MurdochNavigate
===============

Interactive, intelligent navigational assistance for Murdoch University Campus (South Street).

I plan to make quite a few changes to this.
I'll list them when I can.

To open this project in Unity:

'git clone https://github.com/mikeyjk/MurdochNavigate'

Edit Assets/Src/GoogleMaps.cs on Line 48 to include a Google Static Maps API Key. 

It is a free sign up. I was tempted to include my own because there is little chance of someone abusing my key, but it isn't really recommended in the development community.
