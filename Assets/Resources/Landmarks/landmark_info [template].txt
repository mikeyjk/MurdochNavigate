# lines with # are ignored

# if a category/title is missing
# it is simply ignored
# or if it contains only whitespace it is ignored

# path locations pre-suppose the root/parent dir
# is 'Assets/Resources/'

# if there is a lat long, it must have a y value also
# WorldPos is required, if it is not available
# LatLong AND Y are required

# unity doesn't require extensions
# for this reason avoid having duplicate
# file names

# this data should be used for placing models
# but also storing the locations of landmarks
# to allow the user to navigate to them

# 1 landmark can have multiple models and textures
# associated with it
# each model requires 1 position, 1 rotation and 1 scale
# entrances are independent of models
# entrances aren't required, but if they aren't provided
# then the user wont be prompted to navigate to it
# only 1 texture per model is supported

# there can be multiple entrances (and often are)

# if a world position is provided and not a lat long + Y
# the file is written to, to include a lat long and Y
# value.
# this is because lat long + height is scalable at multiple
# zoom levels / is a relative value, where as the worldpos
# value pre-supposes a zoom of 16 which is not ideal
